# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for Fullstack Java Application - CloudFormation, Kubernetes, SonarQube, Maven, Docker, ArgoCD
I have Designed and Implemented CI/CD pipeline as Jenkins for a Fullstack Java application with source control on GitHub and deployment on AWS EC2. Used CloudFormation for Automated infrastructure with containerized applications using Docker and AWS EKS. Set up SonarQube for code quality analysis and installed it as a mail alerting plugin. Used Docker Hub as a container image management tool. Used Maven for build automation and ArgoCD for continuous deployment, gaining experience in CI/CD, DevOps security integration, and cloud-native container orchestration.
